<h2 class="alert alert-warning"><a href="#getting-started" name="getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have a <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/">JIRA account</a>.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have a <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">GitHub account</a>.</li>
  <li>If you're planning to implement a new feature it makes sense to discuss you're changes on the <a href="https://commons.apache.org/mail-lists.html">dev list</a> first. This way you can make sure you're not wasting your time on something that isn't considered to be in Apache Commons CLI's scope.</li>
  <li>Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.</li>
  <li>Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.</li>
  <li>Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.</li>
  <li>Fork the repository on GitHub.</li>
</ul><h2 class="alert alert-warning"><a href="#making-changes" name="making-changes">Making Changes</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (this is usually the master/trunk branch).</li>
  <li>Make commits of logical units.</li>
  <li>Respect the original code style:</li>
  <li>Only use spaces for indentation.</li>
  <li>Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports. If you feel the source code should be reformatted create a separate PR for this change.</li>
  <li>Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.</li>
  <li>Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format. Your commit message should contain the key of the JIRA issue.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.</li>
  <li>Run all the tests with <code>mvn clean verify</code> to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.</li>
</ul><h2 class="alert alert-warning"><a href="#making-trivial-changes" name="making-trivial-changes">Making Trivial Changes</a></h2><p>For changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not always necessary to create a new ticket in JIRA. In this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a commit with '(doc)' instead of a ticket number.</p><h2 class="alert alert-warning"><a href="#submitting-changes" name="submitting-changes">Submitting Changes</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sign the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Contributor License Agreement</a> if you haven't already.</li>
  <li>Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.</li>
  <li>Submit a pull request to the repository in the apache organization.</li>
  <li>Update your JIRA ticket and include a link to the pull request in the ticket.</li>
