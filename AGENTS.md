# AGENTS.md

This repository documents its behavior in `docs/README.md` and the other markdown files under `docs/`.
Read those files first to understand the expected behavior and operational details.

Suggested reading order:

1) `docs/README.md`
2) `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3) `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
4) `docs/PROGRAMS.md`

Notes:

- Source code lives under `src/main/java/`.
- This project is built with Maven; see `pom.xml` for dependencies and plugin configuration.
- Runtime behavior is driven by `settings.src.md` (FreeMarker-based settings file).
